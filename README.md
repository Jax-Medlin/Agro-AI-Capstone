# Agro-AI-Capstone
2024 UNO Capstone Project Repository

Release Notes:

Code Milestone 1:
A python script called ResizeImages.py was created within the utility folder to resize each image down to 1024 by 768. A batch job is being created on the HCC server to resize all of the images.

Code Milestone 2:
A python script called AI.py was created under the model_training folder to train the AI model using EfficientNet. The training is being done on the HCC server. The model uses binary classification to divide the images into either healthy or unhealthy.

Code Milestone 3:
requirements.txt was updated with newer/compatible versions of necessary packages. The home page of the application has been updated and finalized to reflect login functionality. A MySQL database has been set up and includes a Users table to store user login information. Additionally, the process of setting up an Ubuntu server on VMWare has also been started, but technical issues are still being worked out.
